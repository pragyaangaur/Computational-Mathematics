### 1. Prime Distribution

**What it Does:**  
Analyzes how prime numbers are distributed by counting primes in fixed intervals and comparing observed behavior with theoretical expectations.

**Core Idea:**  
Empirical exploration of the Prime Number Theorem through interval-based analysis.

**Approach:**  
	•	Partition integers into intervals of size 100 up to 10⁶  
	•	Count primes within each interval  
	•	Compute expected density using 100/ln(n)  
	•	Measure local deviation from the theoretical estimate  

**How it Works:**  
Prime counts are computed across uniform intervals, producing a distribution of observed densities. These are compared against the asymptotic estimate given by the Prime Number Theorem. The deviation between observed and expected values highlights fluctuations in prime density at finite scales.

**Features:**  
	•	Interval-based prime counting  
	•	Frequency distribution visualization  
	•	Local deviation analysis from theoretical expectation  

**Stack:** Wolfram Mathematica

### 2. Monte Carlo π Estimation

**What it Does:**  
Approximates the value of π using random sampling and visualizes convergence over time.

**Core Idea:**  
Geometric probability via Monte Carlo simulation.

**Approach:**  
	•	Uniformly sample points in a square  
	•	Classify points using the condition x² + y² ≤ 1  
	•	Estimate π from the ratio of points inside the quarter circle  

**How it Works:**  
Random points are generated within a bounded square. Points that fall inside the unit quarter circle are counted, and the ratio of inside to total points is used to approximate π. As the number of samples increases, the estimate converges toward the true value.

**Features:**  
	•	Stochastic sampling-based approximation  
	•	Real-time convergence visualization  
	•	Geometric interpretation of probability  

**Stack:** Python, Matplotlib
